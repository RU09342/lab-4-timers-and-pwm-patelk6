# Hardware PWM
Hardware PWM is much simpler to implement than software PWM. Each board has a set number of PWM pins that will automatically
output a PWM signal (based on chosen parameters). At this point, we make use of them. This is much simpler than software.

## How it is implemented
In order to implement Hardware PWM, we must first check the datasheet, to find out which pins can output a PWM signal.
Once we have this information, we can use that pins' associated timer module to generate our desired wave. We do this by setting
the counting mode of the clock, as well as what actions the clock should take once it reaches designated values. In this instance,
we hitting CCR0, we want to set the value of the pin, and when hitting CCRx we want to reset it. This will result in a PWM
signal being generated off of the pin.
### Technical Info
I mentioned earlier that we set the duty cycle of the PWM by setting the values of the CCRx registers. For hardware PWM,
CCR0 will be the overall period of the wave, and the CCRx (CCR1, CCR2, CCR3, etc.) will represent the duty cycles of the 
pins that those CCR registers are connected to. Again, we are using the button as an interrupt to 
#### Calculations
To calculate the frequency of the PWM wave that is generated by the pins, we multiply the period by the Clock frequency. 
Since we wanted a wave of 1KHz, with SMClk (1 MHz), we set the period (CCR0) equal to 1000. As 1000 * 1000 = 1*10^6, which is
1 MHz.
